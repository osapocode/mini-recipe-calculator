# Mini-Recipe-Calculator

This is my first C++ project and repository on GitHub.

# 🔎 Project Overview

Mini Recipe Calculator is a console-based application that allows user to choose from three receipts. Each recipe contains three ingredients. The user specifies the number of servings, and the program calculates the required amount of each ingredient accordingly.

# 📋 Features

- Calculate ingredient amounts based on the number of servings
- Add a new ingredient to a selected recipe
- Remove an existing ingredient
- Modify the amount of a specific ingredient

# 🛠️ Technologies and Concepts Used
- 1D and 2D arrays, replaced by std::vector for dynamic ingredient management
- Char arrays, replaced by std::string
- struct for recipe abstraction
- Loops and `switch-case` control structures
- Input validation
- Code refactoring to improve readability and reusability
