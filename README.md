# mini-recipe-calculator
This is my first project on GitHub.
This repository contains my first program that I wrote in C++ as a beginner. It is a mini recipe calculator that contains three recipes and three ingredients for each recipe. 
The user enters the number of servings of a particular recipe, and the program calculates the number of products needed to prepare this recipe. 
Three additional options have also been added: adding an ingredient to a specific recipe, removing an ingredient from a specific recipe, and changing the amount of an ingredient in a recipe if their quantity is not satisfactory. When writing the program, I dealt with one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays, an array of strings, after which I improved my program with structures, vectors, loops, and moved the code duplication into a separate function to facilitate readability and code maintenance.
